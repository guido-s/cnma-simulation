### Accepted for publication in BMC Medical Research Methodology


## Example: Cochrane review for postoperative nausea and vomiting

1. Switch to directory *example*

2. Run modelselection.R to conduct CNMA model selection (results are
   stored in directory *example/results*)

3. Run analysis.R to get a summary of the CNMA model selection

4. Run figures.R to create Figures 1, 5, A5, A6, and A7 (stored in
   directory *example/graphics*)


## Simulations to evaluate CNMA model selection

1. Switch to directory *simulation*

2. Run simulations_tau2_0.00.R, simulations_tau2_0.01.R,
   simulations_tau2_0.10.R to conduct simulations (results are stored
   in directory *simulation/results*)

3. Run tables.R to reproduce Tables 3 and 4 (creates files
   *Table3.txt* and *Table4.txt* in directory *simulation/results*)

4. Run mse.R and_cp.R to calculate MSE and CP (creates files *mse.rda*
   and *cp.rda* in directory *simulation/results*)

5. Run figures.R to create Figures 2, 3 and 4, A1, A2, A3 and A4
   (stored in directory *simulation/graphics*)
